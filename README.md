JobaScripts
===========

Some Google Drive scripts which greatly reduce the pain of the job hunt.

Setup
===========
1.  Create a directory in google drive for this project
2.  Create a spreadsheet with columns roughly corresponding to what is being done in the rowHashify function
3.  Create a generic cover letter in a google doc
4.  Convert the google doc to html: File --> Download as --> HTML.
5.  Convert that html file into one that uses all inline styling (gmail strips out <style></style> tags)
